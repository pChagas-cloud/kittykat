<p> If I update this repo, here's what I pretend to do: </p>
<ul align="center">

<li> Daily tasks (tasks that get added everyday) (routine command) </li>
<li> Edit tasks </li>
<li> Task deadline </li>
<li> Task importance (low -- high) </li>
<li> Create separate file for functions, bcs right now it's a fucking mess </li>

</ul>
